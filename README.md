# HiveMind

A collaborative E-commerce website developed as per the module contents of CS2_TP

## Developing:

See the [Rules](https://github.com/EsamKhalid/HiveMind/blob/main/RULES.md) to learn more about commits, contributions and the such.

To get started with contributing towards the project, there is a seamless project structure and style to adhere towards.

This project encompasses Laravel as the means of providing more nuance and ease of use for development.
The basic structure goes as follows:

```
1. Website contents, and or otherwise, your HTML/PHP logic will be inside of the resources/views folder

2. Website routing is handled through the routes folder, followed by the access modifier of the designated routing required.

3. From there, access your web page based off of the name of the file
```
