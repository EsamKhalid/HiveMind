# HiveMind

A collaborative E-commerce website developed as per the module contents of CS2_TP. The website itself is centred around a company that thrives to provide bee-friendly products for its users. The website is divided into 3 seperate views: one as a default guest that has no account with the company, one for users who are logged in and one for admins to administer inventory and manage stock. The design of the website is very minimalistic, making this easier for user navigation through pages whilst also following a specific colour scheme.

NOTE

HiveMind is a website developed solely by students from Team 29 for the module assessment of CS2_TP. 


## Developing:

See the [Rules](https://github.com/EsamKhalid/HiveMind/blob/main/RULES.md) to learn more about commits, contributions and the such.

To get started with contributing towards the project, there is a seamless project structure and style to adhere towards.

This project encompasses Laravel as the means of providing more nuance and ease of use for development.
The basic structure goes as follows:

```
1. Website contents, and or otherwise, your HTML/PHP logic will be inside of the resources/views folder

2. Website routing is handled through the routes folder, followed by the access modifier of the designated routing required.

3. From there, access your web page based off of the name of the file
```
